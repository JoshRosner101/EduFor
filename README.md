# EduFor

Project Name:
EduFor - Educational Forum for Students

Project Description:
We plan on making an educational forum where users can post questions about certain projects (such as if they needed help with a software engineering project). It could be posts about finding other people to collaborate with, or simple questions about how to do certain things.
