# Sprint 2
## Work Completed
- The rewrite of the backend to use a database has been successfully completed. The backend now uses sqlite to create a local database and store post data there instead of memory. This means that data will be saved even when the backend server is shut down and needs to be booted up again.
- The backend and frontend were already integrated, but work has been done to make sure the new database works properly in junction with the front end.
